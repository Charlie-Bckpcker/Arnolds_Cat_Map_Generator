Arnold's Cat Map
===

In mathematics, Arnold's Cat Map is a particular **chaotic map** from the **torus** into itself, named after Russian mathematician Vladimir I. Arnold, who discovered it using an image of a **cat** in the 1960s.

"It is a simple and elegant demonstration and illustration of some of the principles of chaos – namely, underlying order to an apparently random evolution of a system. An image is hit with a transformation that apparently randomizes the original organization of its pixels. However, if iterated enough times, as though by magic, the original image reappears."
