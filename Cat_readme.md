### Arnold's Cat Map 

In mathematics, Arnold's Cat Map is a particular **chaotic map** from the torus into itself, named after Vladimir  Russian mathematician Vladimir I. Arnold, who discovered it using an image of a **cat** in the 1960s.

"It is a simple and elegant demonstration and illustration of some of the principles of chaos â€“ namely, underlying order to an apparently random evolution of a system. An image is hit with a transformation that apparently randomizes the original organization of its pixels. However, if iterated enough times, as though by magic, the original image reappears." 

Arnold's Cat Map $\ \Gamma: \mathbb{T}^{2} \to \mathbb{T}^{2},\\ s.t.\  \Gamma\begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{bmatrix}\end{pmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{bmatrix}
mod\ 1
